## Instructions
1. Run `plot_landscape.m` and other plotting codes in `static_plots` to visualize static energy landscapes for obstacle traversal and self-righting shown in figure 4 of main text.
2. Run  `plot_*.m` codes in `interactive_plots` for interactive figures of potential energy landscapes

### Using interactive plots
- Interactive figures can be used to visualize orthogonal cross-sections of potential energy landscape in the space of three system degrees of freedom.
- For example, for beam energy landscape (image below), potential energy landscape is visualized in the space of body forward position <em>x</em>, body roll, and body pitch.

- Adjust the slider position to change system state shown in top left panel (and by the green dots on landscape panels).
- System state and plots can be reset to the initial state by right-clicking on the button on top right corner
