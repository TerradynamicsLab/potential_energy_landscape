## Instructions
1. Data are included as `.MAT` files and can be opened in `MATLAB`.
2. Run `plot_landscape.m` in `static_plots` to visualize static energy landscapes for obstacle traversal and self-righting shown in figure 4 of main text.
3. Run  `plot_*.m` codes in `interactive_plots` for interactive figure ener
